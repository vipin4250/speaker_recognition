# Speaker Recognition Project

This project focuses on **speaker recognition** using voice data recordings to identify and differentiate between speakers. The repository contains Python code and Jupyter Notebooks that process and analyze audio data to recognize unique speaker characteristics.

## Project Structure

The main directories are organized as follows:

- **result_combined**: Contains the combined results from various tests and models.
- **Shuffled_files / Shuffled_files_nine**: Data folders with shuffled voice recordings.
- **Small_nine / Small_three / three_combined**: Contain smaller, categorized datasets of voice recordings for efficient testing and analysis.
- **.vscode** and **__pycache__**: Include configuration and compiled Python files (excluded from main processing files).

## Installation

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vipin4250/speaker_recognition.git
   cd speaker_recognition
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter notebooks to preprocess and analyze audio data.
2. Use the provided scripts to perform feature extraction and speaker identification.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, scipy, librosa, and others listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Notes

- **Data Exclusion**: Due to file size, the audio dataset is not included in this repository. If youâ€™re testing locally, please use your dataset in the appropriate folder structure.
- **Branch**: All commits and updates are pushed to the **master** branch.
